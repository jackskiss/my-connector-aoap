/**
 * A FlexBuffer wraps a byte array and manages the active region of
 * it (0..length). It also supports dynamically extending the buffer
 * as needed.
 *
 * A FlexBuffer also has an index (read or write cursor). The various
 * get and put operations always occur at the current index, with the
 * index adjusted appropriately afterward. Get will not move index past
 * length. If put needs to move index past length, length is also
 * adjusted. This may cause the byte array to be re-allocated to a
 * larger size.
